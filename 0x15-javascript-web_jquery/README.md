# JavaScript - Web jQuery
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

## Example
        $( "button.continue" ).html( "Next Step..." )
the code is formated like $(element.class_value).html(new_entry)
.html() is a method that gets and sets DOM attributes of elements.
